          I have been a committed primary school teacher. My favorite missions being
          (which seem to me at this time essential) : <br/>
          - to transmit to the children the joy of gardening;<br/>
          - to observe and study the "little animals" that must be left undisturbed;<br/>
          - to introduce them to recycling techniques;<br/>
          - to help them diversify their culinary tastes;<br/>
          - to listen, smell and observe the wonders of flora and fauna during nature trips<br/>
          ...what joy it has given me to see the wonder and enthusiasm it has invoked&#160;!<br/>
          However, my professional and personal conscience is questioned by taking care of children who will have everything to suffer from political irresponsibility.
          <br/>
          How dare they continue in this same old way&#160;? How dare they&#160;?
          <br/><br/>
          <b>So you may ask, what is the logic of confiscating a €9.90 portrait and calling for urgent political measures?</b><br/>

          Well I'm tired of signing the countless petitions like so many others, including those of
          <a target="_blank" href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affaire_du_si%C3%A8cle">"L'Affaire du siècle"</a> with more than 2 million votes; 
          tired of participating in climate marches and being copiously ignored;
          tired of undergoing repression or the prohibition of the right to demonstrate,
          and tired of hearing the NGOs (Non-Government Organisations) and associations yelling in vain warning about the
          destruction of the living world and the destruction of the fabric of society.

          So what remains for a citizen and servant of a flawed Republic?
          <br/><br/>
          This is where the collective action of ANV-Cop21 "Let's take down Macron" comes in!
          Officially launched in February 2019, it denounces the government's political vacuum in the face of
          social and climate issues.
          Its ingenuity is measured by the police and judicial violence that ensued, under the
          pretext of a state of emergency against terrorism. Declared in 2015 it has been dangerously prolonged.
          <br/><br/>
          The president's portrait is by no means obligatory in town halls, it is part of a 19th century republican tradition&#160;!
          A mayor can not be prosecuted for not displaying it.
          You can get married, be born and die without seeing this portrait!
          <br/><br/>
          125 portraits - removed from town halls in France - exhibited at the G7 summit in Bayonne in August 2019,
          100 portraits of Emmanuel Macron brandished upside down by citizens at "D - 100 local elections" in Paris,
          to show that France is not respecting the Paris Agreement.
          And many other local protests where these portraits have been displayed to demonstrate against the government.
          Meanwhile, Mr. Macron continues his eloquent speeches.
          <br/><br/>
          Unfortunately, the only response to these peaceful actions are requisition, police custody and
          hearings - against non-violent environmentalists.
          <br/><br/>
          Yet those who want to listen, the solutions are already known.
          We don't we say that "in the land of the one-eyed, the blind man is king" do we&#160;?
          And nor will these blind policies save us from disaster!
          <br/><br/>
          Treated as a terrorist for this "Let's take down Macron" campaign,
          I am still determined to denounce the government's lack of responsible policy
          in the face of the climate emergency that is threatening our lives and Life on Earth.
          <br/>
          The "Let's take down Macron" activists are whistle blowers.
          They did not carry out a theft but rather a symbolic requisition of a portrait, which will be
          returned contingent on the actions and results of the government.
          <br/><br/>
          Because our children are worth it.
