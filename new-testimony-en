          I have been a committed primary school teacher. 
          My favorite missions being (which I see as essential) : <br/>
          - to transmit to the children the joy of gardening<br/>
          - to observe and study insects and other little animals<br/>
          - to show them how to recycle<br/>
          - to help them diversify their culinary tastes<br/>
          - to take them on nature trips and discover the wonders of flora and fauna<br/>
          What joy it has given me to see their enthusiasm&#160;!<br/><br/>
          I feel compelled to act when not enough is being done for the environment at government level.
          <br/><br/>
          <b>So you may ask, what is the logic of confiscating a â‚¬9.90 portrait and calling for urgent political measures?</b><br/>

          Well I've signed countless petitions,  
	  participated in many climate marches,
          seen the right to protest diminish,
          and heard many various environmental organisations warning about the forthcoming climate catastrophe.
	  All seem to be in vain.
          <br/><br/>
          <b>ANV Cop21 -"Let's take down Macron" campaign</b><br/>
          The collective action of ANV-Cop21 "Let's take down Macron" was launched in February 2019.
	  It denounces the government's non-action concerning social and climate issues.
	  <br/>
	  There has been a severe police response to this action under the pretext of a state of emergency against terrorism. 
	  Declared in 2015 it has been dangerously prolonged.
          <br/><br/>
          The president's portrait is by no means obligatory in town halls, it is part of a 19th century republican tradition&#160;!
          A mayor can not be prosecuted for not displaying it.
          You can get married, be born and die without seeing this portrait!
          <br/><br/>
          To show that France is not respecting the Paris Agreement :
	  - 125 portraits were removed from town halls in France and exhibited at the G7 summit in Bayonne in August 2019<br/>
          - 100 portraits of Emmanuel Macron brandished upside down by citizens at "D - 100 local elections" in Paris         
          <br/><br/>          
          The "Let's take down Macron" campaigners did not carry out a theft but rather a symbolic requisition of a portrait<br/>
          ... which will be returned contingent on the actions of the government.
          <hr/>
          We know what the solutions are to the climate problem, but it needs courageous government action to implement the correct measures.
	  <br/><br/>
          I seem to have been treated like a terrorist for this "Let's take down Macron" campaign, but
          I am still determined to continue my protest for the environment.
